   <h1>Setup:</h1>
   <p>
      For the setup, the entire map consists of 19 hexagon tiles combining into a big hexagon. <br/>
      Each hexagon represents a different source of materials with a total of 4 grains, 4 lumbering, 4wools, 3 bricks, 3 ores and 1 desert. <br/>
      These positioning of the tiles are randomized at the beginning of the game. <br/>
      Excluding the desert tile, each tile is assigned with a number between 2 to 12 excluding the number 7, where 2 and 12 only appears once and the others twice each. <br/>
      There are nine harbours surrounding the entire map. <br/><br/>
  </p>

  <h1>Game Cards:</h1>
  <p>
      There are 25 development cards:<br/> -14 knight cards <br/>  -5 victory points cards <br/> -2 monopoly cards <br/> -2 road building cards <br/> -2 year of plenty cards <br/><br/>
      <b>Knight:</b>  Move the robber. Steal 1 resource from the owner of a settlement or city adjacent to the robber’s new hex. <br/>
      <b>Victory Points: </b> Reveal this card on your turn if, with it, you reach the number of points required for victory. <br/>
      <b>Monopoly:</b> When you play this card, announce 1 type of resource. All other players must give you all of their resources of that type. <br/>
      <b>Road Building:</b> Place 2 new roads as if you had just built them. <br/>
      <b>Year of Plenty:</b> Take any 2 resources from the bank. Add them to your hand. They can be 2 of the same resource or 2 different resources. <br/><br/>
  </p>

  <h1>Game phases:</h1>
  <p>
     <b>Roll the dice</b><br/>
      The player will roll two dice, the result is the sum of the dice. 
      For each settlement a player owns adjacent to a terrain hex with the rolled number, 
      he receives one resource of the type produced by that terrain. <br/>
      (Note: the result applies to all players) <br/>
      If a “7” is rolled, it activates the robber. All players who own more than 7 resources must discard half of their resource cards. <br/>
      The active player moves the robber to any other resource tile of his choice, then chooses a player with a settlement adjacent to the tile and steals a random resource
      - provided that the player has a resource. <br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
     <b>Trade</b><br/>
      There are two types of trades, you can trade with players or trade with the bank. <br/>
      For trading with players, you can propose what resources you need and what you are willing to offer for it.  <br/>
      Other players can accept your proposal and make counter offers as well. <br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
     <b>Building</b> <br/>
     You may build a road, build a settlement, upgrade a settlement into a city or buy a development card. <br/>
     To build a road, it requires 1x lumbering and 1 x brick. A new road must always be connected to 1 of your existing roads, settlements or cities. <br/>
     To build a settlement, it requires 1 lumber, 1 brick, 1 wool and 1 grain. <br/>
     Each settlement may only be built at an intersection if all 3 of the adjacent intersections are vacant. <br/>
     Each of the settlements must be connected to at least 1 of the player’s own roads. <br/>
     The owner of the settlement receives 1 resource card whenever the resource tile produces during dice rolls. <br/>
     Each settlement is worth 1 victory point. <br/>
     To upgrade a settlement into a city, it requires 3 x ore and 2 x grain. <br/>
     A city acquires 2 resource cards instead of 1 for an adjacent resource tile that produces resources. <br/>
     Each city is worth 2 victory points. <br/>
     To buy a development card, you will need 1 ore, 1 wool and 1 grain. <br/> <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
     <b>Play a card</b> <br/>
     At any time during the turn, the player may play 1 development card, however the card may not be played during the same turn it was bought.  <br/>
     A development card never goes back into the supply after being used.  <br/><br/>
  </p>
  <p>
     <b>End of turn</b> <br/>
     By ending the turn, the system detects whether the player has 10 or more points, if the player does, the player wins the game. <br/>
     A player does not win the game if the player has 10 or more points while it is not his turn. <br/> <br/>
  </p>
  <h1>Bonus way to earn points</h1>>
  <p>
     <b>Longest Road</b> <br/>
     If a player is the first player to build a continuous road of at least 5 road pieces, they earn this special card called “Longest Road” which is worth 2 victory points. <br/>
     However if another player builds a longer road, this special card is handed over to the player with the longer road. <br/> <br/>
     <b>Largest Army</b>
     If a player is the first player to play 3 knight cards, they earn this special card called “Largest Army” which is worth 2 victory points. <br/>
     However, if another player plays more knight cards than the original holder of “Largest Army”, this special card is handed over to the player who has played more knight cards. <br/><br/>
